# **Introduction**

Exact logistic regression is used to model binary outcome variables in which the log odds of the outcome is modeled as a linear combination of the predictor variables. It is used when the sample size is too small for a regular logistic regression (which uses the standard maximum-likelihood-based estimator) and/or when some of the cells formed by the outcome and categorical predictor variable have no observations. The estimates given by exact logistic regression do not depend on asymptotic results.
